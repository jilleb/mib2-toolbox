## What can I do with this?
Customize your MIB2HIGH unit graphics, patch Android Auto so it can run custom apps, and apply all kinds of cool tweaks and mods to your infotainment.

## Why doesn't it install?
- Make sure you have an MIB2 High and you are using the latest version.

## Can this remove component protection?
- Removing component protection is not legal. You can probably modify this tool to remove component protection in some way. But that's like eating soup with a fork: it's not the intented use and I do not agree with it.

## Can this give me more FECs?
- Probably, but then you still need to find a way to sign them.

## Can this enable Android Auto / CarPlay?
- No. That's a SWaP feature, and your dealer is happy to help you.

## Why do I get a variant-conflict error?
- This happens when you tried installing it on a non MIB2-HIGH system. It will **not** work on MIB1 or MIB2 Standard units. Discover Media / Compostion Media is not MIB2 HIGH!

## Why do I get a "script not found" error?
- Make sure you are using the latest version of the script.

## When will you make a toolbox for MIB2 Standard?
- I don't have any access to a Discover Media or Composition Media to try and develop/test a solution. The MIB2High toolbox is the result of a lot of research about MIB2H vulnerabilities and possibilities, I am completely in the dark when it comes to Discover/Composition Media units.
