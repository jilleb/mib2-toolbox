## What can I do with this?
Customize your MIB2HIGH unit graphics, patch Android Auto so it can run custom apps.

## Why doesn't it install?
- Make sure you have an MIB2 High.

## Can this remove component protection?
- Removing component protection is not legal. You can probably modify this tool to remove component protection in some way. But that's like eating soup with a fork: it's not the intented use and I do not agree with it.

## Can this give me more FECs?
- Probably, but then you still need to find a way to sign them.

## Can this enable Android Auto / CarPlay?
- No. That's a SWaP feature, and your dealer is happy to help you.
